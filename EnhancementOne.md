# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

   The artifact that I am using for the software design and engineering category is my final
project from cs 320 that I completed on April 18, 2021.  It is a medical application that 
is used to schedule appointments, collect contact information, and provide a list of tasks 
to be completed.  The goal of this class was to complete an application that automated the 
process of collecting information and provided module testing in the form of Junit tests 
that made sure the information entered was correct and did not result in an error like 
buffer overflow.

   I selected this item because it is a good example of testing, data collection, and software 
application all in one.  The junit tests, private helper methods, appropriate access modifiers
and limits on parameters are components of the artifact that showcase my ability to develop a 
syntactically accurate, logical, and efficient application.  I improved the artifact by 
expanding the scope of the junit tests and search modules. 

   In my original project I only made junit tests that focused on the assert true method that a 
variable was within its projected parameters.  I added twice as many junit tests that provided
an assert false method which tested for data that was outside the scope of my earlier tests.  
I also added new variables like first and last names to attach to the list which kept track of
appointment for my medical app.  This list originally was only designed to look up a unique 
identification by search through the list, but I added several more search methods which applied
to all the other variables listed.

   I believe that I med most of the course objectives that I planned to meet in module one.  
I improved the syntax of my project and expanded its scope. I do not currently have any further 
updates to my outcome-coverage plans. 

   When enhancing my project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too 
ambitions.  The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were common sense improvements
and extensions.  It also helped that I hadnâ€™t looked at my project for some months and could look at
it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced were attempting to get tests to function properly
and test the correct data.
