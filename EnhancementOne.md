# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my text-based adventure game project from IT-145, originally developed in Java during my earlier coursework. This project was designed as a console-based game where players could navigate through different rooms, interact with objects, and progress through the story. For my enhancement, I transformed the game into a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Java Swing, applied advanced design patterns, and later ported the entire project from Java to Python to improve flexibility, modernize the codebase, and align with industry trends.

This artifact was selected because it showcases a range of skills, including object-oriented programming, GUI development, and software engineering best practices. The original project already demonstrated fundamental skills in game logic, modular code structure, and interactivity. However, the enhancements significantly expanded the scope and complexity of the project. I incorporated design patterns such as Singleton for managing game settings, Observer for tracking game state changes, and Factory for efficiently creating game elements like rooms and items. Porting the project to Python introduced additional challenges and learning opportunities, allowing me to explore Python’s object-oriented features and libraries for GUI development.

The enhancements included transitioning the game from a text-based interface to a GUI application, which improved usability and engagement. Key features added include inventory management, room exploration through clickable buttons, and dynamic score tracking on the screen. These features were implemented first in Java and later adapted to Python using libraries such as Tkinter, which provided a lightweight yet effective framework for GUI development. Porting the project to Python also reduced the code complexity, made the project easier to maintain, and allowed for future integration with Python’s extensive ecosystem of libraries.

One major improvement was the addition of interactive GUI components. Players can now use buttons to navigate rooms, pick up or drop items, and track their scores through a user-friendly interface. The Singleton design pattern manages the game state, ensuring centralized and consistent control of settings and data. The Observer pattern dynamically updates the GUI as players interact with the game, enhancing responsiveness and immersion. These features were successfully implemented in both Java and Python, highlighting my ability to adapt and improve a project across different programming environments.

Through this enhancement, multiple course objectives were met. I demonstrated the ability to use well-founded software engineering techniques to create maintainable and efficient applications. The transition from Java to Python showcases my adaptability and commitment to leveraging modern tools and technologies. I also improved the usability, scalability, and accessibility of the project, aligning it with industry standards. This artifact reflects my development growth by demonstrating my ability to modernize a basic project and make it more advanced, user-focused, and versatile.

Enhancing this project taught me the importance of setting practical goals and revisiting previous work with fresh perspectives. Porting the project to Python provided a deeper understanding of language-specific nuances and reinforced the value of choosing the right tools for a given task. The most significant challenges included integrating GUI components with the existing game logic and ensuring that design patterns were applied correctly across both languages. These challenges allowed me to refine my problem-solving skills and gain experience in cross-language development.

This enhanced artifact exemplifies my ability to deliver professional-quality software solutions by leveraging object-oriented programming, design patterns, and a user-focused approach. By porting the project to Python and introducing GUI elements, I have demonstrated my adaptability, commitment to continuous improvement, and readiness to apply these skills to real-world software development challenges.
