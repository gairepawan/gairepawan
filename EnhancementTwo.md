# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact that I am using for the algorithms and data structure category is a project from CS-405 
that I completed on August 8th, 2021. It is a test module that was designed to search a collection of 
entries in a data structure for functionality and exploitable weaknesses. 

I selected this artifact because it is an excellent example of secure coding practices being used to 
protect data structures and algorithms.  One of the major weaknesses of any publicly available service 
application is the exploitability of its interface.  A common attack made on these applications is a 
buffer overflow attack that allows a malicious hacker to overflow an input’s parameters for a denial of 
service attack or attempt to access the application’s data.  

In my original project, I included mostly positive assertions for the tests because that was what I was 
required to do.  For this artifact however, I increased the amount and variety of tests that were applied
in the testing module.  Most of the tests that were included in the pre-enhancement artifact were positive
asserts that verified something was true about a sample collection of entries like its max size is greater 
than ten.  For my enhancement, I introduced more tests that tested a negative or in other words verified 
that a given assertions was false.  

I believe that I completed my course objectives for enhancing this artifact.  I improved the complexity and
number of tests that were used to ensure the collection’s data structures and algorithm parameters were 
properly protected. I do not currently have any updates on my outcome-coverage plans. 

When I was enhancing my artifact, I learned to appreciate adding to a project that I worked on weeks ago.  
When I completed the activity that this artifact was based on, I only did what was necessary to complete 
the assignment and get a satisfactory grade but being able to return to my previous work and improve it 
helpedme to appreciate the original purpose and scope of CS-405. I also struggled with trying to remember 
the nuances of the assignment it was based off even though I only completed it a month ago.
