## **Professional Self-Assessment**
Hello, my name is **Pawan Gaire**, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**. As I complete my final class, this ePortfolio serves as a culmination of my academic journey, showcasing my growth, achievements, and ability to solve real-world problems through innovative solutions. My time in the Computer Science program has provided me with hands-on experience in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. These experiences have prepared me to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

My academic journey at SNHU has been instrumental in shaping my technical and professional skills. The program has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, database management, and algorithm design, enabling me to design, implement, and enhance practical solutions that align with industry standards. I’ve learned to apply advanced design patterns such as Singleton, Observer, and Factory to create modular and maintainable systems. My coursework in algorithms and data structures has taught me to optimize performance using tools like linked lists and hash maps, while my work in databases has involved integrating relational and NoSQL systems into full-stack applications. Beyond technical expertise, the program has also emphasized teamwork, communication, and security, ensuring I am well-prepared for collaborative and professional environments.

The artifacts in this ePortfolio reflect my ability to design, develop, and enhance solutions in three critical areas of computer science. My first artifact demonstrates my work in **Software Design and Engineering**, where I transformed a text-based adventure game into a GUI-based application using Java Swing. This project highlights my ability to apply design patterns to improve scalability, maintainability, and user experience. The second artifact focuses on **Algorithms and Data Structures**, showcasing a C++ program enhanced with linked lists, sorting and filtering algorithms, and a dynamic command-line interface (CLI) for improved interactivity. Lastly, my **Database** artifact is a travel website developed using the MEAN stack, transformed into a secure, dynamic single-page application (SPA) with authentication, real-time data management, and an administrative dashboard. These projects collectively demonstrate my technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and ability to create user-focused solutions.

Here's how I have met the program’s core outcomes throughout my academic journey:

**Course Outcome 1: (Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.)**

I met this outcome by fostering collaboration and engaging with peers and stakeholders throughout my projects. For instance, during the enhancement of my database artifact, I incorporated feedback to refine its functionality and ensure it met the needs of both technical and non-technical users. The travel website's design allows for collaborative data entry, making it accessible to users with varying technical expertise. Additionally, my experience conducting code reviews and working on team projects helped me understand the importance of collaboration in creating high-quality solutions that align with organizational goals.

**Course Outcome 2: (Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.)**

I achieved this outcome by ensuring clear and professional communication in every aspect of my work. Each artifact is accompanied by detailed documentation and narratives that explain the rationale behind enhancements, making the projects accessible to technical and non-technical audiences alike. For example, in my software design artifact, I provided clear descriptions of the GUI functionality and how it improves user experience. These efforts demonstrate my ability to deliver professional-quality communications tailored to diverse audiences and contexts.

**Course Outcome 3: (Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.)**

I met this outcome by designing and evaluating efficient computing solutions in my algorithms and data structures artifact. Enhancements such as linked lists, sorting, and filtering algorithms addressed specific user needs while balancing trade-offs in complexity and performance. These updates demonstrate my ability to apply algorithmic principles to develop practical and scalable solutions that align with computer science practices and standards.

**Course Outcome 4: (Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.)**

I fulfilled this outcome through the advanced tools and techniques utilization in my database artifact. By leveraging the MEAN stack, I developed a secure and dynamic single-page application (SPA) that included real-time data management and an administrative dashboard. This project showcases my ability to adopt innovative technologies to create impactful and industry-relevant solutions. The enhancements also demonstrate my ability to integrate both front-end and back-end systems seamlessly.

**Course Outcome 5: (Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.)**

I met this outcome by implementing security-focused enhancements in my projects, particularly the travel website artifact. I incorporated authentication and input validation mechanisms to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks. I also tested these security measures thoroughly to ensure the protection of user data. These efforts reflect my commitment to designing secure systems that prioritize privacy and data integrity, meeting professional security standards.

By meeting each of these outcomes, I have demonstrated my ability to apply core computer science principles and practices in ways that are technically sound, user-focused, and aligned with industry expectations. These accomplishments underscore my readiness to contribute effectively to real-world challenges in the tech industry.

# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

   The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my final project from 
CS-320 that I completed on April 18, 2021.  It is a medical application that is used to 
schedule appointments, collect contact information, and provide a list of tasks to be 
completed.  The goal of this class was to complete an application that automated the 
process of collecting information and provided module testing in the form of JUnit tests 
that made sure the information entered was correct and did not result in an error like 
buffer overflow.

   This item was selected because it is a good example of testing, data collection, and software 
application, all in one.  The junit tests, private helper methods, appropriate access modifiers
and limits on parameters are components of the artifact that showcase my ability to develop a 
syntactically accurate, logical, and efficient application.  The artifact is improved by 
expanding the scope of the junit tests and search modules. 

   In the original project, JUnit tests focused on the assert true method that a variable was 
within its projected parameters.  Twice as many JUnit tests were added that provided
an assert false method which tested for data that was outside the scope of my earlier tests.  
New variables were also added like the first and last names to attach to the list which kept track of
appointment for my medical app.  This list was originally only designed to look up a unique 
identification by searching through the list, but I added several more search methods which applied
to all the other variables listed.

   For this artifact, most of the course objectives were met. The syntax of my project was improved
and expanded in its scope. I do not currently have any further updates to my outcome-coverage plans. 

   When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too 
ambitions.  The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were common sense improvements
and extensions.  It also helped that I hadn’t looked at my project for some months and could look at
it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced were attempting to get tests to function properly
and test the correct data.

# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact used for the algorithms and data structure category is a project from CS-405 
that was completed on August 8th, 2021. It is a test module that was designed to search a collection of 
entries in a data structure for functionality and exploitable weaknesses. 

This artifact was selected, because it is an excellent example of secure coding practices being used to 
protect data structures and algorithms.  One of the major weaknesses of any publicly available service 
application is the exploitability of its interface.  A common attack made on these applications is a 
buffer overflow attack that allows a malicious hacker to overflow an input’s parameters for a denial of 
service attack or attempt to access the application’s data.  

In the original project, mostly positive assertions were included for the tests because that was what was 
required for completion.  For this artifact however, the amount and variety of tests were increased that applied
in the testing module.  Most of the tests that were included in the pre-enhancement artifact were positive
asserts that verified something was true about a sample collection of entries like its max size is greater 
than ten.  For this enhancement, more tests were introduced that tested a negative or in other words verified 
that a given assertions was false.  

The course objectives were completed for enhancing this artifact.  I improved the complexity and
number of tests that were used to ensure the collection’s data structures and algorithm parameters were 
properly protected. I do not currently have any updates on my outcome-coverage plans. 

When I was enhancing my artifact, I learned to appreciate adding to a project that I worked on weeks ago.  
When I completed the activity that this artifact was based on, I only did what was necessary to complete 
the assignment and get a satisfactory grade but being able to return to my previous work and improve it 
helpedme to appreciate the original purpose and scope of CS-405. I also struggled with trying to remember 
the nuances of the assignment it was based off even though I only completed it a month ago.

# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact used for the databases category is a project from CS-340 that was completed 
on June 6th, 2021.  It is a python file that was designed to interact with pymongo to work as the
back end structure of an interactive database for animal rescue centers.  The pre-enhancement 
artifact contains basic CRUD functionality while the post-enhancement artifact contains more 
advanced SQL functions.

This project was selected as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  The information contained within these databases is searched and
modified by commonly used languages like python. The inclusion of create, read, update, and delete 
SQL functionality along with additional improvements like count, insert multiple, update multiple,
and delete multiple commands were significant refinements made to my artifact in the enhancement phase.
These enhancements showcase the ability to expand upon and update SQL and python data structure code. 

I feel like I completed all the course objectives that I was meant to complete for this milestone.  
I improved the complexity of my artifact and updated its functionality to include count, delete multiple,
insert multiple, and update multiple SQL commands.  I do not currently have any updates to my outcome 
coverage plans.  

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to appreciate both basic and advanced SQL commands especially
when it came to CRUD or create, read, update, and delete.  Just including those four SQL functions in my
python code allowed me to create a functional database for animal rescues in my original project.  After 
updating my code, I learned just how much a few changes can influence the final design of my project for 
the better.
