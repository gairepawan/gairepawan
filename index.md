# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

   The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my final project from 
CS-320 that I completed on April 18, 2021.  It is a medical application that is used to 
schedule appointments, collect contact information, and provide a list of tasks to be 
completed.  The goal of this class was to complete an application that automated the 
process of collecting information and provided module testing in the form of JUnit tests 
that made sure the information entered was correct and did not result in an error like 
buffer overflow.

   This item was selected because it is a good example of testing, data collection, and software 
application, all in one.  The junit tests, private helper methods, appropriate access modifiers
and limits on parameters are components of the artifact that showcase my ability to develop a 
syntactically accurate, logical, and efficient application.  The artifact is improved by 
expanding the scope of the junit tests and search modules. 

   In the original project, JUnit tests focused on the assert true method that a variable was 
within its projected parameters.  Twice as many JUnit tests were added that provided
an assert false method which tested for data that was outside the scope of my earlier tests.  
New variables were also added like the first and last names to attach to the list which kept track of
appointment for my medical app.  This list was originally only designed to look up a unique 
identification by searching through the list, but I added several more search methods which applied
to all the other variables listed.

   For this artifact, most of the course objectives were met. The syntax of my project was improved
and expanded in its scope. I do not currently have any further updates to my outcome-coverage plans. 

   When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too 
ambitions.  The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were common sense improvements
and extensions.  It also helped that I hadn’t looked at my project for some months and could look at
it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced were attempting to get tests to function properly
and test the correct data.

# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact used for the algorithms and data structure category is a project from CS-405 
that was completed on August 8th, 2021. It is a test module that was designed to search a collection of 
entries in a data structure for functionality and exploitable weaknesses. 

This artifact was selected, because it is an excellent example of secure coding practices being used to 
protect data structures and algorithms.  One of the major weaknesses of any publicly available service 
application is the exploitability of its interface.  A common attack made on these applications is a 
buffer overflow attack that allows a malicious hacker to overflow an input’s parameters for a denial of 
service attack or attempt to access the application’s data.  

In the original project, mostly positive assertions were included for the tests because that was what was 
required for completion.  For this artifact however, the amount and variety of tests were increased that applied
in the testing module.  Most of the tests that were included in the pre-enhancement artifact were positive
asserts that verified something was true about a sample collection of entries like its max size is greater 
than ten.  For this enhancement, more tests were introduced that tested a negative or in other words verified 
that a given assertions was false.  

The course objectives were completed for enhancing this artifact.  I improved the complexity and
number of tests that were used to ensure the collection’s data structures and algorithm parameters were 
properly protected. I do not currently have any updates on my outcome-coverage plans. 

When I was enhancing my artifact, I learned to appreciate adding to a project that I worked on weeks ago.  
When I completed the activity that this artifact was based on, I only did what was necessary to complete 
the assignment and get a satisfactory grade but being able to return to my previous work and improve it 
helpedme to appreciate the original purpose and scope of CS-405. I also struggled with trying to remember 
the nuances of the assignment it was based off even though I only completed it a month ago.

# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact used for the databases category is a project from CS-340 that was completed 
on June 6th, 2021.  It is a python file that was designed to interact with pymongo to work as the
back end structure of an interactive database for animal rescue centers.  The pre-enhancement 
artifact contains basic CRUD functionality while the post-enhancement artifact contains more 
advanced SQL functions.

This project was selected as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  The information contained within these databases is searched and
modified by commonly used languages like python. The inclusion of create, read, update, and delete 
SQL functionality along with additional improvements like count, insert multiple, update multiple,
and delete multiple commands were significant refinements made to my artifact in the enhancement phase.
These enhancements showcase the ability to expand upon and update SQL and python data structure code. 

I feel like I completed all the course objectives that I was meant to complete for this milestone.  
I improved the complexity of my artifact and updated its functionality to include count, delete multiple,
insert multiple, and update multiple SQL commands.  I do not currently have any updates to my outcome 
coverage plans.  

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to appreciate both basic and advanced SQL commands especially
when it came to CRUD or create, read, update, and delete.  Just including those four SQL functions in my
python code allowed me to create a functional database for animal rescues in my original project.  After 
updating my code, I learned just how much a few changes can influence the final design of my project for 
the better.
