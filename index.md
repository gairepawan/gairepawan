# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my text-based adventure game project from IT-145, originally developed in Java during my earlier coursework. This project was designed as a console-based game where players could navigate through different rooms, interact with objects, and progress through the story. For my enhancement, I transformed the game into a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Java Swing, applied advanced design patterns, and later ported the entire project from Java to Python to improve flexibility, modernize the codebase, and align with industry trends.

This artifact was selected because it showcases a range of skills, including object-oriented programming, GUI development, and software engineering best practices. The original project already demonstrated fundamental skills in game logic, modular code structure, and interactivity. However, the enhancements significantly expanded the scope and complexity of the project. I incorporated design patterns such as Singleton for managing game settings, Observer for tracking game state changes, and Factory for efficiently creating game elements like rooms and items. Porting the project to Python introduced additional challenges and learning opportunities, allowing me to explore Python’s object-oriented features and libraries for GUI development.

The enhancements included transitioning the game from a text-based interface to a GUI application, which improved usability and engagement. Key features added include inventory management, room exploration through clickable buttons, and dynamic score tracking on the screen. These features were implemented first in Java and later adapted to Python using libraries such as Tkinter, which provided a lightweight yet effective framework for GUI development. Porting the project to Python also reduced the code complexity, made the project easier to maintain, and allowed for future integration with Python’s extensive ecosystem of libraries.

One major improvement was the addition of interactive GUI components. Players can now use buttons to navigate rooms, pick up or drop items, and track their scores through a user-friendly interface. The Singleton design pattern manages the game state, ensuring centralized and consistent control of settings and data. The Observer pattern dynamically updates the GUI as players interact with the game, enhancing responsiveness and immersion. These features were successfully implemented in both Java and Python, highlighting my ability to adapt and improve a project across different programming environments.

Through this enhancement, multiple course objectives were met. I demonstrated the ability to use well-founded software engineering techniques to create maintainable and efficient applications. The transition from Java to Python showcases my adaptability and commitment to leveraging modern tools and technologies. I also improved the usability, scalability, and accessibility of the project, aligning it with industry standards. This artifact reflects my development growth by demonstrating my ability to modernize a basic project and make it more advanced, user-focused, and versatile.

Enhancing this project taught me the importance of setting practical goals and revisiting previous work with fresh perspectives. Porting the project to Python provided a deeper understanding of language-specific nuances and reinforced the value of choosing the right tools for a given task. The most significant challenges included integrating GUI components with the existing game logic and ensuring that design patterns were applied correctly across both languages. These challenges allowed me to refine my problem-solving skills and gain experience in cross-language development.

This enhanced artifact exemplifies my ability to deliver professional-quality software solutions by leveraging object-oriented programming, design patterns, and a user-focused approach.

# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact used for the algorithms and data structures category is a project originally developed during my CS-300 coursework. It is a C++ program that loads data from a file into an unordered map, demonstrating efficient key-value data storage and retrieval. For this enhancement, I expanded the project by incorporating additional data structures and functionality, emphasizing secure coding practices, improved usability, and algorithmic efficiency.

This artifact was selected because it demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and enhance secure and efficient data structures while addressing real-world challenges. The original project focused on basic functionality, using an unordered map to store and retrieve data based on unique keys. For the enhanced version, I integrated a linked list to track user actions dynamically, added sorting and filtering algorithms for data management, and created a more interactive command-line interface (CLI) for better usability. These enhancements showcase my ability to combine multiple data structures and algorithms effectively.

One of the key improvements was the expansion of the testing module to include more comprehensive tests. In the original project, the testing was limited to basic assertions, such as verifying that the map contained entries or that its size exceeded a certain threshold. For the enhancement, I added negative tests to ensure the program could handle invalid data gracefully and prevent issues such as buffer overflows or invalid input errors. This focus on robust testing reflects my commitment to secure coding practices and protecting algorithms and data structures from potential exploits.

The enhanced program now includes features like dynamic entry tracking using a linked list, which keeps a history of recent actions. Sorting algorithms allow users to organize data alphabetically or by custom criteria, while filtering functions enable users to view subsets of the data based on specific parameters. The command-line interface was redesigned to provide clear prompts and error messages, making the program more intuitive and user-friendly. These additions not only improved the functionality of the program but also aligned it with industry standards for usability and efficiency.

Through this enhancement, several course objectives were met. I demonstrated the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles, as seen in the implementation of sorting and filtering functionalities. Secure coding practices were emphasized by expanding the testing suite to include more rigorous validations, protecting the program from potential vulnerabilities. These enhancements highlight my ability to combine technical expertise with a user-centered approach to create practical and secure applications.

Enhancing this artifact taught me the value of revisiting and improving previous work. When I originally completed the project, my focus was on meeting the assignment requirements. Revisiting it for enhancement allowed me to see its growth potential and appreciate its foundational purpose. One of the challenges I faced was understanding the nuances of the original assignment and integrating new features without disrupting the existing functionality. This process required careful planning, debugging, and a deep understanding of both the original code and the enhancements.

This artifact now reflects my ability to design secure, efficient, and user-friendly solutions while addressing real-world challenges in algorithms and data structures. By enhancing the project with additional features and robust testing, I have demonstrated my commitment to continuous improvement and my readiness to apply these skills in professional environments.

# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact used for the databases category is a project from CS-340 that was completed 
on June 6th, 2021.  It is a python file that was designed to interact with pymongo to work as the
back end structure of an interactive database for animal rescue centers.  The pre-enhancement 
artifact contains basic CRUD functionality while the post-enhancement artifact contains more 
advanced SQL functions.

This project was selected as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  The information contained within these databases is searched and
modified by commonly used languages like python. The inclusion of create, read, update, and delete 
SQL functionality along with additional improvements like count, insert multiple, update multiple,
and delete multiple commands were significant refinements made to my artifact in the enhancement phase.
These enhancements showcase the ability to expand upon and update SQL and python data structure code. 

I feel like I completed all the course objectives that I was meant to complete for this milestone.  
I improved the complexity of my artifact and updated its functionality to include count, delete multiple,
insert multiple, and update multiple SQL commands.  I do not currently have any updates to my outcome 
coverage plans.  

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to appreciate both basic and advanced SQL commands especially
when it came to CRUD or create, read, update, and delete.  Just including those four SQL functions in my
python code allowed me to create a functional database for animal rescues in my original project.  After 
updating my code, I learned just how much a few changes can influence the final design of my project for 
the better.
