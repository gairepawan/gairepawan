# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact that I am using for the databases category is a project from CS-340 that I completed 
on June 6th, 2021.  It is a python file that was designed to interact with pymongo to work as the
back end structure of an interactive database for animal rescue centers.  The pre-enhancement 
artifact contains basic CRUD functionality while the post-enhancement artifact contains more 
advanced SQL functions.

I selected this project as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  The information contained within these databases is searched and
modified by commonly used languages like python. The inclusion of create, read, update, and delete 
SQL functionality along with additional improvements like count, insert multiple, update multiple,
and delete multiple commands were significant refinements made to my artifact in the enhancement phase.
These enhancements showcase my ability to expand upon and update SQL and python data structure code. 

I feel like I completed all the course objectives that I was meant to complete for this milestone.  
I improved the complexity of my artifact and updated its functionality to include count, delete multiple,
insert multiple, and update multiple SQL commands.  I do not currently have any updates to my outcome 
coverage plans. 

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to appreciate both basic and advanced SQL commands especially
when it came to CRUD or create, read, update, and delete.  Just including those four SQL functions in my
python code allowed me to create a functional database for animal rescues in my original project.  After 
updating my code, I learned just how much a few changes can influence the final design of my project for 
the better.
