# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact I selected for the databases category is a travel webpage created using Express during my CS-465 Full Stack Web Development course. Initially, the project was a simple platform designed to display travel destinations, contact information, and other essential travel-related data. This artifact demonstrates my ability to integrate databases into dynamic web applications and highlights my growth in creating robust, secure, and user-focused solutions.

This project was selected because it represents my foundational understanding of database management and web development while offering significant opportunities for enhancement. The original version included basic database operations using MongoDB and Mongoose, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data. The enhancements I implemented expanded this functionality to include secure user authentication, an administrative interface for managing travel data and transforming the webpage into a single-page application (SPA) for improved responsiveness and user experience.

During the enhancement phase, I introduced several advanced features. First, I implemented a secure login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), allowing authenticated access to the administrative dashboard. The dashboard enables administrators to add, edit, and delete travel data, with real-time updates reflecting changes instantly on the user-facing side. Additionally, I strengthened input validation to ensure data integrity and security, preventing invalid or malicious entries from impacting the database. The SPA transformation utilized Angular, enabling seamless navigation and dynamic data updates without refreshing the page.

These enhancements align with the program's course outcomes by demonstrating my ability to design and implement database-driven applications that are secure, scalable, and user-friendly. Specifically, the project addresses Course Outcome 3 by showcasing my ability to evaluate and refine computing solutions using algorithmic principles and database management practices. Course Outcome 4 is also reflected in my use of advanced tools like the MEAN stack to deliver a professional-grade application that meets industry standards.

Working on this artifact taught me valuable lessons in database integration, security, and responsive web application design. I deepened my understanding of MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, explored best practices for authentication and authorization, and learned how to manage real-time data synchronization between administrative and user-facing interfaces. The challenges of building a SPA structure and ensuring seamless data flow between the front end and back end improved my problem-solving skills and provided practical insights into full-stack development.

This enhanced artifact demonstrates my ability to create secure, dynamic, and interactive applications by leveraging database technologies and modern development frameworks. It reflects my readiness to tackle real-world challenges and my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions that align with user needs and industry expectations.
